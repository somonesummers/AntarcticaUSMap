This is a script used to plot portions of the US against Antarctica for reference purposes. I couldn't find this easily accessible, so wanted to share. 

This builds on https://github.com/vraida/Lambert-projection and uses boundary files from https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html. All these have been included in this directory and should work for you as is. 

projection_constants.json controls the constants of the Lambert projection, I use the values used by the US VFR section charts with standard parallels at 33°N and 45°N. The origin for the projection x,y grid is set at the center of the Continental US.
